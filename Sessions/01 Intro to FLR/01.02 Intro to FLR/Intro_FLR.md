## What is FLR?

# Why, oh why?
Schnute et al. (2007 and 1998) compared the number of
software tools and languages currently available for stock
assessments with the Babel tower myth:

> "After the people of Babel sought to build a tower to heaven, the Lord
> God devised a plan (Genesis 11: 4-7). ’Behold the people is one; and
> they all have one language; and this they began to do; and now nothing
> will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.... Let us
> go down, and there confound their language, that they may not
> understand one another’s speech.’ Italics highlight the prospects for
> accomplishment with a common language, if the scientific community
> could ever agree on one"

# Mission statement

The FLR project attempts to develop and provide a platform for quantitative fisheries science based on the R statistical language. The guiding principles of FLR are openness, through community involvement and the open source ethos, flexibility, through a design that does not constraint the user to a given paradigm, and extendibility, by the provision of tools that are ready to be personalized and adapted. The main aim is to generalize the use of good quality, open source, flexible software in all areas of quantitative fisheries research and management advice.

# FLR goal

Promote the use of Management Strategy Evaluation and similar simulation-based techniques for the exploration of weakness and strengths of management options and quantitative advice. The FLR toolset will allow for relatively simple building, and as efficient as possible running, of MSE simulations Graphical output tailored to different audiences

- Stock assessment and provision of management advice
  - Well tested, robust methods
  - Open to detailed inspection
- Data and model validation through simulation
- Risk analysis
- Capacity development & education
- Promote collaboration and openness in quantitative fisheries science
  - Open source
  - Community involvement
  - R as lingua franca
- Support the development of new models and methods
  - Extensible toolset
  - Links to other tools (ADMB, BUGS, …)
  - Bring the R community and software to fisheries
