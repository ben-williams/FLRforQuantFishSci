% Training Course on **USING FLR FOR QUANTITATIVE FISHERIES ADVICE**
% European Commission Joint Research Centre
% 18-22 March 2013. Ispra, Italy

The Maritime Affairs Unit - FISHREG of the European Commission Joint Research Centre (JRC Ispra), Institute for the Protection and Security of the Citizen (IPSC) is pleased to announce a training course on USING FLR FOR QUANTITATIVE FISHERIES ADVICE, which will cover the use and application of the tools developed by the FLR project (http://flr-project.org) to the quantitative analysis of fisheries data and the provision of advice on stock status and forecast.

The FLR library is a collection of tools in the R statistical language that facilitates the construction of bio-economic simulation models of fisheries and ecological sytems. It is a generic toolbox, but is specifically suited for the construction of simulation models for evaluations of fisheries management strategies. The FLR library is under development by researchers across a number of laboratories and universities.

The course will introduce the basic structure of FLR, familiarize users with the available procedures and methods, cover the most important steps of interest to participants in stock assessment working groups, and present the ways in which FLR code can be adapted and extended to your needs.

# DATES & VENUE

This course will take place over 8 half-day sessions, on 18-22 March 2013 in at the Casa Don Guanella conference centre [http://www.vareseconvegni.it/], in Barza, Ispra, Italy. The course will start at 13.00 on Monday, 18 March, and end at 12.00 on Friday 22 March 2013.

Accomodation on a half-board basis is available at the course venue, but participants are free to stay elsewhere.

Shuttle transport will be organized from Milano Malpensa airport (MXP) to the meeting venue at given times, but participants unable to make use of the service will need to make their own arrangements

# REQUIREMENTS

The course is designed for a maximum of 35 participants. The working language is English. Participants are expected to be familiar with fisheries models, and fluent in the R statistical language. 

Participants are required to bring their own laptops to connect to a local area network. They should be able to install software and additional packages.

# ADMISSION AND REGISTRATION

Please register online at http://. Deadline for submission of applications is **15 February 2013**.

Their is no course fee, but participants must cover their travel and living expenses.
